/**
 * Pins the iOS development team onto every build configuration of the app
 * target during prebuild.
 *
 * Why this exists: `expo prebuild --clean` regenerates ios/*.pbxproj from
 * scratch, which wipes the DEVELOPMENT_TEAM that Xcode wrote when you picked a
 * team in Signing & Capabilities. And Xcode only writes it to the *active*
 * configuration, so a Debug-signed project fails a Release build with the
 * useless "requires a development team" error. This applies it to all
 * configurations, every prebuild, so signing survives a clean and is not
 * config-dependent.
 *
 * The team id is deliberately NOT committed. It is not a security secret -- it
 * cannot be used to sign anything without the private key, and it ships inside
 * every distributed iOS app -- but it is a personal identifier tied to a real
 * Apple account, and this is a public repo for a censorship-resistance tool
 * where linking the author's Apple identity to the project is exactly the kind
 * of avoidable exposure worth avoiding. So it is read at build time from, in
 * order:
 *
 *   1. the APPLE_TEAM_ID environment variable, or
 *   2. a gitignored `signing.local.json` next to this repo: {"appleTeamId":"…"}
 *
 * If neither is present the plugin does nothing, so the repo still prebuilds
 * for anyone else -- they just supply their own team when they sign.
